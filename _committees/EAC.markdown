The Education Advisory Committee (EAC) was formed to support volunteers of all sectors working as educators. Currently we are focused on reshaping our teacher training programs, collecting feedback and providing constructive recommendations to staff. We are here to support volunteers and help them become confident and excellent teachers. Please let us know if you have any feedback about your experience as an educator, or have any suggestions about how we can help support you. Watch out for our newsletter and send us an email at eacpctz@gmail.com.

Our staff champions are the Education sector APCD's, Paul and Anna.
